<p><b>Frank "Lucky"</b> (or <b>"Lucks"</b>) <b>Tower</b> is the subject of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legend">urban legend</a> that said that he was a stoker (or fireman, in some versions)[1] who survived the sinking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic">RMS Titanic</a>, <a href="RMS Empress of Ireland">RMS Empress of Ireland</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania">RMS Lusitania</a>. There is no evidence that anyone was involved in all three disasters, and no one with the name of Frank Tower on the crew list on any of these vessels' respective voyages; however, there was a survivor named Frank Tower from the Lusitania, and a William Clark who survived both the Titanic and Empress of Ireland sinkings.[2]</p>
<p>The legend claims that he was a coal stoker on the Titanic, and survived after she sank on her maiden voyage on 14 April 1912. Two years later, on 28 May 1914, Frank was allegedly aboard the Empress of Ireland when she collided with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collier_(ship)">collier</a> Storstad in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lawrence_River">Saint Lawrence River</a>. This disaster was considered the worst peacetime maritime disaster in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Canada">history</a>, and Tower was one of only 465 of the 1477 aboard to survive. During <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">WWI</a>, Tower allegedly was serving as a crew member aboard the RMS Lusitania. In the early afternoon of 7 May 1915, she was <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo">torpedoed</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_German_Navy">German</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat">submarine</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM_U-20_(Germany)">U-20</a> and sank eighteen minutes later. (It is rumored that he shouted "Now what?!" when the torpedo struck.) Again, Tower escaped the sinking ship, and swam to a nearby lifeboat.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley%27s_Believe_It_or_Not!">Ripley's Believe It or Not</a> reported the legend as if it were verifiably true</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Cussler">Clive Cussler</a> briefly cites this legendary figure in his nonfiction book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Hunters:_True_Adventures_with_Famous_Shipwrecks"></a>The Sea Hunters</a>, in the chapter concerning the U-20. He relates that after the sinking of the Lusitania, Tower swore that he would take up farming and never go to sea again</p>
